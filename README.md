### Project Notes

I learned a lot from putting together this project. It really helped me see how HTML, CSS, and JS work together to create an experience for the user. This is the first time I combined all three languages to create something.

### Features to Add

####Paintbrush
Adjusts opacity to gradually darken the boxes rather than simply changing background-color. This would require the default bg color to be black, or whatever color you want to darken to, in my case #c2c2c2.

#####How to Implement
* Marker would change `opacity` to `1`
* Paintbrush would change `opacity` to `+= 0.1`
* Eraser would change `opacity` to `0`
* Rainbow would change `opacity` to `1` *and* adjust `background-color` to a random value
