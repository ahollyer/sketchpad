### Project Notes

I learned a lot from putting together this little app. It really helped me see how HTML, CSS, and JS work together to create an experience for the user. This is the first time I combined all three languages to create something.

### Features to Add

#### Paintbrush
Adjusts opacity to gradually darken the boxes rather than simply changing background-color. This would require the default bg color to be black, or whatever color you want to darken to, in my case #c2c2c2.

##### How to Implement
* Marker would change `opacity` to `1`
* Paintbrush would change `opacity` to `+= 0.1`
* Eraser would change `opacity` to `0`
* Rainbow would change `opacity` to `1` *and* adjust `background-color` to a random value
